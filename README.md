# Amazon-Sales-Report-Analysis

### Project Overview

Embark on a data-driven odyssey as I unravel the complexities of Amazon's marketplace in India. This project is a deep-dive analysis into the sales reports, where I aim to decode the patterns, preferences, and performance that shape one of the largest e-commerce landscapes.

With a trove of sales data at our fingertips, I will employ sophisticated analytical techniques to dissect the nuances of consumer behavior and sales efficacy. My toolkit is equipped with Tableau for its robust data manipulation capabilitie.

The expedition will chart a course through:

  1. Sales Performance Metrics: Gauging the pulse of Amazon's sales, identifying top-performing categories and products.
  2. Customer Buying Trends: Understanding the demographic and psychographic factors that influence purchasing decisions.
  3. Seasonal Sales Variations: Capturing the ebb and flow of sales across different seasons and festivals.
  4. Regional Sales Disparities: Exploring the geographical nuances that dictate sales distribution across India.

My mission is to distill vast datasets into strategic insights, fostering informed decision-making for stakeholders. By the culmination of this project, we aim to present a strategic compendium of findings that could steer Amazon's sales strategies towards greater success in the Indian market.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

 ### Recomendations
1.	With 'Set' having the highest quantity by a significant margin, ensure that inventory management practices are optimized for this category to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
2.	Since Maharashtra has the highest quantity and sum of amount, consider focusing marketing efforts and distribution resources in this state to capitalize on its strong performance.
3.	The extreme difference between the highest and lowest quantities suggests a very concentrated market. Consider diversifying the product range to reduce dependency on a single category.
4.	Analyze the pricing strategy in Maharashtra, as it has the highest sum of amount, to ensure it aligns with customer expectations and market conditions.
5.	Develop strategies to enhance customer relationships in states with lower sales and amount figures to increase market share.
6.	Look into the supply chain processes in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to ensure they are as efficient as Maharashtra, which might help increase their quantities and sum of amount.
7.	Investigate the factors that led to the significant increase in the Sum of Amount and Quantity between March 31, 2022, and June 29, 2022. Understanding these factors can help replicate the conditions that led to the increase.
8.	Since both Sum of Amount and Quantity started trending down on June 15, 2022, it's important to identify the causes of this decline. This could be due to seasonal changes, market saturation, or other external factors.
9.	The steep incline in Sum of Amount from March 31 to April 2 suggests a potential sales or marketing event that was very successful. Consider replicating this event or strategy to boost sales in future periods.
10.	Amazon accounting for a significant portion of Quantity, and Bengaluru for a significant portion of Quantity by city, focus on these high-performing merchants and cities for targeted marketing and stock allocation.
11.	Allocate stock strategically to meet the high demand in top-performing cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.
12.	Monitor the pricing strategy closely, especially during periods of high sales, to maximize revenue without deterring customers.
13.	Conduct a detailed analysis of customer behavior during the periods of high sales to better understand the drivers of purchase decisions.
14.	Given the fluctuations in Quantity, improve inventory turnover through better forecasting and demand planning to avoid excess stock and stockouts.
15.	With a significant disparity between the Sum of Amount for 'Shipped' and 'Shipped - Damaged', it's crucial to investigate and improve quality control and packaging processes to reduce the incidence of damaged shipments.
16.	Given that 'Expedited' shipping has a higher quantity than 'Standard', consider promoting expedited shipping options more aggressively, as there seems to be a preference or need for faster delivery among customers.
17.	'Amazon' has a higher quantity for other fulfillment compared to 'Merchant'. This suggests that Amazon's fulfillment services are more effective or preferred. It may be beneficial to increase the use of Amazon's fulfillment services or analyze what makes them more successful and apply those practices to merchant fulfillment.
18.	The high difference in quantity between 'Shipped' and 'Cancelled' orders indicates that reducing cancellations could significantly impact overall sales. Investigate the reasons behind cancellations and address them to improve customer satisfaction and retention.
19.	Ensure that inventory levels are sufficient to meet the demand for expedited shipping, and optimize the supply chain to handle the quick turnaround times required for these orders.
20.	Collect and analyze customer feedback, especially for damaged shipments and cancelled orders, to understand the underlying issues and address them.
21.	Implement performance metrics for shipping and handling that focus on reducing damage rates. Consider incentives for staff or third-party logistics providers who meet or exceed these metrics.
22.	Cancellation Prevention Strategies: Develop strategies to prevent cancellations, such as better product descriptions, accurate stock levels, and improved customer service interactions.
